Tab Flow: The path of least resistance
======================================

*Tab Flow* is an extension for Google Chrome which allows you to better manage your open tabs.

Installation
------------
Until I can get a logo/icon made and put this in the Chrome Store, follow these instructions:

1. Download the .crx file from here
    1. Click the link for "Tab Flow.crx"
	2. Click the link for "View Raw"
	3. Save the file somewhere you can find it easily
2. Open the Extensions page in Google Chrome (Settings -> Extensions)
3. Drag the file from where you saved it into the Extensions window and click "Add" when prompted

Usage
-----
- type something into the search box (e.g. youtube) to filter by all tabs that mention "youtube"
    - don't worry about capitalization
- if you want to search by the URL instead of the title, check the box for "Use URLs"
- if you click the link of a tab, you'll be redirected to that tab
- clicking "Bookmark" will bookmark the current list of tabs into a new folder on the Bookmark Bar
    - the new folder will have the current date and time to keep things separated
- clicking "Move" will move the current list of tabs to a new window
    - this is handy for keeping work/school/personal life separate
- clicking "Close" will (of course) close the current list of tabs
    - there's no "Re-Open" button, so be sure you want to close them
