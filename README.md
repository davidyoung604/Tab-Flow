Tab Flow: The path of least resistance
======================================

*Tab Flow* is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to better manage your open tabs.

Installation
------------
Until I can get a logo/icon made and put this in the Chrome Store, follow these instructions:

1. Download the .crx file from [here](https://github.com/davidyoung604/Tab-Flow/blob/master/Tab%20Flow.crx?raw=true) and save the file somewhere you can find it easily
2. Open the Extensions page in Google Chrome (Settings -> Extensions)
3. Drag the file from where you saved it into the Extensions window and click "Add" when prompted

Usage
-----
- Type something into the search box (e.g. youtube) to filter by all tabs that mention "youtube"
    - Don't worry about capitalization
- If you want to search by the URL instead of the title, check the box for "Use URLs"
- If you click the link of a tab, you'll be redirected to that tab
- Clicking "Bookmark" will bookmark the current list of tabs into a new folder on the Bookmark Bar
    - The new folder will have the current date and time to keep things separated
- Clicking "Move" will move the current list of tabs to a new window
    - This is handy for keeping work/school/personal life separate
- Clicking "Close" will (of course) close the current list of tabs
    - There's no "Re-Open" button, so be sure you want to close them

Notes
-----
- The number on the icon is the number of open tabs you have across all open windows.
- If you find a bug or have a feature request, please post it in the [Issues](https://github.com/davidyoung604/Tab-Flow/issues) section so we can keep things organized.
